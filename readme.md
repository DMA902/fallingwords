# Disclaimer

This game was built to demonstrate the use of the Ebiten game library, and therefore is not fully featured. A few things that could be improved upon include:

- Ability to select difficulty in the Title screen such Easy, Normal, Hard
- Currently there's only one increase in difficulty after 35 words completed. This could be made more intelligently, and more finely tuned
